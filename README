Program Description

This program is designed to replicate the popular card game "BlackJack". 

This program was written using C# by Danie Otto on 2019/08/28.
The goal of this program was to exercise C# object-oriented programming principles. 

Please note, the BlackJack game Github repository contains the Microsoft visual studio .sln file which can be used
to view the source code. The program application .exe can be found in the following directory tree,
"BlackJack_2019 > bin > Debug > BlackJack.exe".

The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching a card sum of 21 without going over. 
The game starts by a dealer dealing two cards to the player and two to him or herself. 
The player can see his or her two cards while only one card of the dealer is visible while the other is upside down. 
The player then has to decide whether to "Hit" or to "stay". 
If the player chooses hit, the dealer deals them another card. The player can choose to hit as many times as they wish.
The player however automatically losses once their card sum is greater than 21. 
Once the player has achieved a card total they are contempt with, they must then choose to stay.
It then becomes the dealers turn to play. 
The dealer can also hit or stay. The dealer however must follow specific rules.
If the dealers card sum is below 17, the dealer must hit. If the card sum is 17 or greater, the dealer must stay. 
The game can be won by either the player or the dealer through achieving a higher score than the other without exceeding 21.
